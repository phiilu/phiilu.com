I started using Setapp and I really like it. I think it brings a lot of value for a low price. Lots of app included in Setapp are very usefull and you could buy them all seperatly, but would also have to upgrade the license yearly (eq Tableplus).

Here are a list of apps I use that are included with Setapp:

- [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/) - to have a clean menubar
- [Forecast Bar](https://forecastbar.com/mac) - to see the current weather right in my menubar
- [Lungo](https://sindresorhus.com/lungo) - if I don't want my Mac to go to power saving mode
- [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/) - a great app for writing
- [Receipts](https://www.receipts-app.com/) - organizing my receipts and see what I spent
- [CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com/) - the best screenshoting app on macOS
- [Sizzy](https://sizzy.co/) - a great tool to help you with developing responsive websites
- [TablePlus](https://www.tableplus.io/) - the best database tool on macOS
- [Renamer](https://renamer.com/) - for renaming lots of files quickly
