In 2019 I changed my normal wallet to a slimwallet from Secrid and it was a really good decision. I hated putting my normal wallet into my pocket because it was so thick. Having a slimwallet means getting rid of coins, but that was quite easy for me to do. Paying with card is much faster, keeps my wallet slim and I get nice statistics in my banking app.
