Although this Macbook Pro is already a few years old, it still gets the job done! I got the base model and upgraded the SSD to 512 GB and the RAM to 16GB. The only problem I have is the [keyboard](https://support.apple.com/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks). But this is a known issue and only from time to time one of the keys gets stuck. Annoying, if you keep in mind that this laptop was more than 2000â‚¬
