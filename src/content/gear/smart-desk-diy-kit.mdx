I wanted a standing desk for a long time but did not find any desks that fit all the criteria that I wanted.

- at least 3 saved configurations
- real wood desk
- 180cm length
- should not cost more than 500â‚¬

After looking at a ton of standing desks I was disappointed that I could not find one that would be a great fit for me. After a few YouTube videos, I found out that Autonomous is offering a DIY standing desk kit. I looked at it and I was so happy ðŸ˜„

The reason for this was, I already knew which tabletop I wanted. The [KARLBY butcher block](https://www.ikea.com/at/de/p/karlby-arbeitsplatte-nussbaum-furnier-30335191/). It looks so good and has the perfect length of 180cm. And the best part is that it is real wood.

So it was decided. I ordered the DIY Kit and the IKEA KARLBY butcher block. Assembly was really easy.

My dream desk!
