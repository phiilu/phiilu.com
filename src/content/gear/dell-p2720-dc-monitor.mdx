Dell makes one of the best monitors for office related work. As a developer I am working with a lot of text editors, thus text needs to be crisp and sharp. This monitor has an IPS panel which has great viewing angles and for sharp text. I sometimes play casual games on it too. It's not designed for gaming, so don't expect too much. For my needs, the display is more than enough.

A great feature of this display is that it has an integrated USB-C port with a power delivery of up to 65W. You just need one cable to connect your MacBook to your monitor and charge it. Pretty awesome.

This monitor has 27" with a resolution of 2560 × 1440. I did not buy a 4K display on purpose. The reason for this is, that the Dell monitor with 4K costs twice as much as this one. I think that 2K is the sweet spot when it comes to price–performance.
