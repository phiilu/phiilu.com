If you just sit in front of a computer for 2-3 hours a day then this chair is great and comfy. I found this company in a Twitch stream and I really love how the chair looked, so I ordered one and I like it. One of the best looking chairs I have ever owned.

For longer sessions, I would suggest checking out an ergonomic chair. These racing styled chairs are not very ergonomic and don't have features to support your posture. Still a good chair though.
