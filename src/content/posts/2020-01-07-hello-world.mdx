Hey I am [Phiilu](https://phiilu.com) and this is my first blog post ever! I always wanted to blog and share my knowledge with
the world, but I never had the courage to do it.

**Reasons for this were:**

- English not being my native language
- Being too shy saying something wrong
- Having nothing useful or interesting to share
- Too lazy ðŸ˜…

Now it's 2020 and it's time that I stop giving a f\*ck what other people think and actually put myself out there.
I need to stop worring about what others may say, or others may reply. Writing and posting something that I find interesting, or I think
could help someone is what I want to do! If only one person thinks that one of my posts helped him/her, than this blog is already a big success!

## Who is this guy?

In my day-to-day job I am working as a **Frontend Developer** for a agency.
[React](https://reactjs.org/) and the projects evolving around React are my daily working tools. Before specialising in Fronted, I started with Backend.
Everything started with me learning Ruby on Rails and Java, but at some point I learned more and more about Javascript/Node.js and ended up using and loving React.

I really like to code, but also setting up services on servers. I always loved configuring servers, this is why I am still hosting a lot of services by myself.
This is where a lot of my knowledge about the internet and the [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) comes from and how our modern internet is working.

That should be enough about me, if you want to know more, you can check [my personal website](https://kapfenberger.me/) out.

## What can you expect?

I am mostly interested in technical related topics like:

- Setting up services on servers
- Programming related content
- Consumer Electronics

But I really don't want to restrict myself on what to write here. Maybe one day I want to try out a 7 day fast and share my progress here ðŸ¤” .

My goal though is to give people value by sharing my experiences and (hopefully) helpful tutorials. All my life I have been a consumer and consumed
various blog posts, articles and videos that helped me through my life.

Now it's time to give something back!
