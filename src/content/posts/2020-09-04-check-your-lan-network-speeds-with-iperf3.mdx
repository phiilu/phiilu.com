When you are installing new network cables or a new router/switch you might want to test if your equipment performs as it should.

I recently installed new CAT 7 cables which I had crimped myself. Therefore I wanted to test if what I did was actually working and giving me the maximal theoretical speed of **1 Gbit/sec** in my network.

When you want to test your internet speed you are usually used to going to a website like [speedtest.net][1] or [fast.com][2]. Those websites are great if you want to test your ISP's network speed, but usually not great if you want to test your **LAN** network speed. Of course, if you have a 1 Gbit/sec up and downlink contract with your ISP, those sites should work too.

For the rest of us, who don't have those extreme speeds we need to use tools that are using our LAN network.

`iperf3` is an excellent tool to measure LAN network speeds and to find bottlenecks or bad network equipment.

In the following, I will show how to install `iperf3` and how to use it for a basic network test.

## Install iperf3

First of all, we need to install `iperf3` on both devices that you want to test.

### Debian/Ubuntu

```
sudo apt install iperf3
```

### macOS

```
brew install iperf3
```

## Testing your LAN speeds

`iperf3` is a client-server application, which means it will need to run on two different computers to work.

First, determine which of your device should be the server and which should be the client. It does not matter which device has which role.

In my case, I chose my Raspberry Pi as the server and my MacBook Pro as the client.

On the server device you just start the iperf3 in server mode:

```
iperf3 -s
```

In your terminal window, you should now see that your server is ready

```
-----------------------------------------------------------
Server listening on 5201
-----------------------------------------------------------
```

On your client device you will now have to connect to the server:

```
iperf3 -c 192.168.1.10
```

> Note that you should change the IP address to the one of the server

```
Connecting to host 192.168.1.10, port 5201
[  5] local 192.168.1.179 port 63816 connected to 192.168.1.10 port 5201

[  5]   2.00-3.00   sec   112 MBytes   935 Mbits/sec
[  5]   3.00-4.00   sec   111 MBytes   928 Mbits/sec
[  5]   4.00-5.00   sec   113 MBytes   945 Mbits/sec
[  5]   5.00-6.00   sec   112 MBytes   943 Mbits/sec
[  5]   6.00-7.00   sec   112 MBytes   941 Mbits/sec
[  5]   7.00-8.00   sec   112 MBytes   941 Mbits/sec
[  5]   8.00-9.00   sec   112 MBytes   941 Mbits/sec
[  5]   9.00-10.00  sec   112 MBytes   941 Mbits/sec

[  5]   0.00-10.01  sec  1.10 GBytes   940 Mbits/sec                  receiver

iperf Done.
```

Now you can see how fast your LAN speeds are. If you have a 1Gbit/sec network like me you should see speeds around `940 Mbits/sec`.

This is really close to the theoretical 1Gbit/sec. You can repeat the test multiple times as there can be different results depending on the systems load.

## Additional options to use

Here I will list some extra options that you can pass to `iperf3`. If you want to check out more options use the man pages by typing `man iperf3` into the terminal.

### Parallel test streams

If you have more than 1 Gbits/s you can try to use the `-P` parameter to run multiple test streams at once at parallel.

```
iperf3 -c 192.168.1.13 -P 3
```

iperf Done.
```

You see that there are now 3 test streams occupying the full 1 Gbit/sec bandwidth.

### Changing the displayed speed format

By default `iperf3` will show you the speed in `Mbit/sec`, but you can change that with the `-f [kmgtKMGT]` option.

To display `Gbit/sec` you can you use the following command:

```
iperf3 -c 192.168.1.13 -f g
```

## Conclusion

Now you know how you can test your own LAN network and it is not that difficult too. Next time you notice a drop in transfer speed between your NAS and computer, you may want to check your connection with `iperf3` and figure out where the problem could be ðŸ˜„
