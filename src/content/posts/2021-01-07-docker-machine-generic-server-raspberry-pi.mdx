If you have a slow computer or you somehow can't install Docker using the official [Docker Desktop][1] installer, you might want to use your Raspberry Pi (or any other server you have) to be your dedicated Docker server.

Recently I had the problem that I could not install Docker Desktop in my VM that was running on my [Unraid][2] server. The problem is that on Ryzen CPUs nested virtualization is not (yet) supported on the OS that I used. [Nested virtualization][3] means that you can run a VM inside a VM.

So I could not use the official Docker for Mac installer to install Docker, I had to find another way.

The answer to this was `docker-machine`.

## What is docker-machine?

`docker-machine` is a CLI program from Docker that allows you to use `docker` as you would normally, but execute the commands on a server instead. This is useful if you have multiple servers running docker and you can control them all by just changing the docker environment with one command `docker-machine env YOUR_ENV`.

If you don't have `docker-machine` installed, try to install it with your OSs package manager or download it from [GitHub][5].

On macOS you can install it like this from brew:

```bash
brew install docker-machine
```

Even if you can't install Docker Desktop, you should still be able to download the `docker` CLI, you will need it.

## Preparing our server

Before we use `docker-machine` we need to make some configurations on the server first.

I would recommend creating a new user that will be used to login with `docker-machine`.

```bash
adduser docker-machine
```

Next, we need to allow the new user to execute commands with `sudo`, but with the addition that the user can use it without entering its password. This might be a security risk, so make sure the password of the `docker-machine` user is strong and your server is properly hardened.

Edit the `sudoers` file by writing `visudo` into your terminal and append a new line after the entry for `root`.

```bash
docker-machine ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

Save and quit the editor.

The `docker-machine` generic driver does not recognize the `raspbian` OS, so we need to trick it, by temporarily changing the `ID` field in the `/etc/os-release` to `debian`.

```bash
#/etc/os-release
PRETTY_NAME="Raspbian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)"
NAME="Raspbian GNU/Linux"
VERSION_ID="10"
VERSION="10 (buster)"
VERSION_CODENAME=buster
ID=debian
ID_LIKE=debian
HOME_URL="http://www.raspbian.org/"
SUPPORT_URL="http://www.raspbian.org/RaspbianForums"
BUG_REPORT_URL="http://www.raspbian.org/RaspbianBugs"
```

Finally, you will need to set up public-key authentication on your server with the `docker-machine` user. I have documented the process on how you can do this in [another article][6]. Scroll down to the **"Skip passwords with public key authentication"** section and follow the steps to set it up.

Now your server should be ready to install docker using `docker-machine`.

## Install docker on your server with docker-machine

Now that you have the docker-machine CLI installed on your machine, we can use it to install docker on the server using just one command.

```bash
docker-machine create \
  --driver generic \
  --generic-ip-address=192.168.1.13 \
  --generic-ssh-user=docker-machine \
  --generic-ssh-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa \
  rpi
```

```output
Running pre-create checks...
Creating machine...
(rpi) Importing SSH key...
Waiting for machine to be running, this may take a few minutes...
Detecting operating system of created instance...
Waiting for SSH to be available...
Detecting the provisioner...

Checking connection to Docker...
Docker is up and running!
To see how to connect your Docker Client to the Docker Engine running on this virtual machine, run: docker-machine env rpi
```

That's it you should now have docker installed on your server!

## Change your docker environment with docker-machine

Now if you want to execute docker commands on the server you just need to change your docker environment with the following command:

```bash
eval $(docker-machine env rpi)
```

If you always want to use the server environment, put the line into your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file.

## Start using Docker

After changing the environment with `docker-machine` you can use `docker` the same way that you would do normally!

```bash
docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
```

## Useful docker-machine commands

- `docker-machine ls` - list all environments
- `docker-machine rm ENV` - deletes an existing environment
- `docker-machine ip ENV` - get the IP address of the server
- `docker-machine ssh ENV` - open an SSH connection to the server

## Conclusion

`docker-machine` is a cool tool and it is very easy to set up and use. I find this approach very interesting. For now, the setup is working quite well and I did not see any drawbacks to it.

The only different thing is that I will have to use the IP of my server instead of `localhost` if I want to access services running on docker.
