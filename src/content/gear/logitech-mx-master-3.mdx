A really good mouse. I use it daily and it is probably the best mouse I ever had. I like the integration with macOS. I can use mission control and switch spaces very easily with gestures with that mouse. The different Bluetooth profiles are great too. I can switch between my Mac and Windows PC by just changing the profile on the bottom of the mouse. The battery lasts long too and can be recharged very fast with USB-C. All in all a very good mouse and I am very happy with it. In the future, I might buy the Logitech MX Vertical to have a more ergonomic mouse.
