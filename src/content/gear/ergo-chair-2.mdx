I love my Secretlab Omega chair, but I was looking for something more ergonomic. After my research, I found a few chairs that I thought would be great. Unfortunately we are in a pandemic and most stores are closed, so I had to rely on reviews on the internet and YouTube videos.

A lot of people had recommended the [Herman Miller Aeron](https://store.hermanmiller.com/office/office-chairs/aeron-chair/2195348.html?lang=en_US) and I believe them that this is the best office chair money can buy. The problem with this chair is that it costs a lot of money (up to 2000$ ðŸ¤¯) and there is only one store in Austria that sells it.

The second most recommended chair was the ErgoChair 2 from Autonomous. I liked the look of the chair and the features it had. Many people liked it and so I ordered it. After sitting on it for a few weeks now, I can say that it is a comfy chair. My back pain has definitely reduced and I really like the headrest. For 369$ this is a great high/mid-range chair, which has a lot of features that high-end chairs have.
