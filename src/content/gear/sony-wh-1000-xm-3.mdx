The Sony WH-1000XM3 are the best NC (Noise Cancelling) headphones I ever owned. The sound is really good and the NC is even better. I never want to go to the office again without my Sony headphones. They block every outside noise and I can focus on my work. They are that good that I don't even hear the doorbell and friends need to call me on my phone and ask if I am at home The biggest limitation is that you can only connect one device at a time. This is annoying when I want to switch between my Mac and my iPhone.
